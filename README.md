When I first began my Master's program I was intrigued by Farrokh Ayazi's course called Interface IC Design which was in the appendix of courses also approved for the Bioengineering program. I expected it to be about biological-electronics interfaces, but it was actually about the circuitry between Microelectromechanical Systems (which are analog) and other circuitry. The idea is such sensors often give off weak signals that need to be amplified without introducing too much noise. Characterizing the signals involved a deep analysis of each one and quite a few confusing approximations.

For homework 2 we had to design an accelerometer from scratch and simulate it in COMSOL. `accelerometer design` contains the assignmnet and files associated with that. The analysis to pair with it is in hard copy on my shelf.

Our final assignment was a term paper, `CMOS Gas Sensors`. I chose chemical sensing as my topic, since it seemed applicable to the biological world and remains a hole in our electronic sensing abilities. That is, while MEMS can now sense acceleration, rotation, sound, and light much more sensitively, reliably, and on much broader spectra than animals, computers still can't smell.
